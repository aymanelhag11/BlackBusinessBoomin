## Overview
### Description
This app lets users either promote or find deals on local businesses that use instagram as a main platform for promotion. The app will use instagram to fetch data to populate the users home screen with different deals.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:
Retail/social

- **Mobile:**
primarily mobile app
- **Story
Users can hopefully filter by location and find coupons for things they need whose services can hopefully be provided by a black owned business to help some of the small businesses effected by the Pandemic.
- **Market:**
Seeing as to this is a local project, it would initially be just for around this area. Perhaps just the DMV area. Targetted at Black Business but not limited to.

- **Habit:**
Users and Owners will use this opp as often as they need to. Services range from hair for girls, which is as often as you would like, to photo shoots with an upcoming photographer who has taken pictures for multiple main stream artists in his career. Whatever you are feeling.
- **Scope:**
At first it woul start by targrtting a list of maybe five businesses for project purposes but would evetually expand past the DMV and be nationwide and the user would just have to add a location to filter offers they recieve. Maybe try AI so that if the user is only using the same coupon and not so much another, that other coupon would stop showing up and more coupons like the one that is frequently used will show.
